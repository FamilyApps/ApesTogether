# üö® GROK: Help Debug Vercel Cron Job Not Creating Daily Snapshots

## THE PROBLEM

My Flask stock portfolio app on Vercel has a **recurring daily issue**: the market close cron job either isn't running or isn't creating portfolio snapshots.

**Expected:**
- Every weekday at 4:00 PM EDT (20:00 UTC), create portfolio snapshots for all users
- Charts should show today's data (Sept 30, 2025)
- Happens automatically via Vercel cron

**Actual:**
- Charts show last data point from YESTERDAY (Sept 29)
- Market closed 2+ hours ago (4:00 PM EDT today)
- I manually ran cache rebuild at 6:31 PM EDT - no new data points added
- This happens **EVERY SINGLE DAY**

---

## ATTACHED FILES

I'm attaching:
1. **`GROK_MARKET_CLOSE_DEBUG.md`** - Comprehensive technical analysis
2. **Vercel Cron Logs (screenshots/JSON)** - Last 24 hours of cron executions:
   - Market Close cron log
   - Intraday cron log  
   - Market Open cron log

---

## KEY CONTEXT

- **Vercel Pro plan** (paid subscription for cron jobs)
- **3 cron jobs configured** in `vercel.json`:
  - Market open: `30 13 * * 1-5` (9:30 AM EDT)
  - Intraday: `30 13,14,15,16,17,18,19 * * 1-5` (every 30 min during market hours)
  - Market close: `0 20 * * 1-5` (4:00 PM EDT) ‚Üê **THIS ONE ISN'T WORKING**

- **Endpoint:** `/api/cron/market-close` in `api/index.py`
- **What it should do:**
  1. Create `PortfolioSnapshot` for each user with today's date
  2. Update leaderboard cache
  3. Update chart cache
  4. Commit all changes atomically

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

1. **Analyze the Vercel cron logs** - Are the jobs running? Failing? Timing out?

2. **Identify the root cause:**
   - Is the cron not triggering?
   - Is the endpoint being called but failing?
   - Is it running but not creating snapshots?
   - Timezone issues?

3. **Provide specific fix:**
   - What configuration to change?
   - What code to modify?
   - How to verify it's working?

4. **Explain why this happens DAILY:**
   - This isn't a one-time bug
   - It's a systematic failure
   - What's the underlying issue?

---

## PREVIOUS FIXES (Didn't solve this)

- ‚úÖ Fixed `calculate_portfolio_value()` fallback logic (prevents $0 snapshots)
- ‚úÖ Added per-user cache rebuild (avoids timeouts)
- ‚úÖ Cleaned corrupted zero-value snapshots
- ‚ùå **But the cron job still doesn't create daily snapshots**

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

When fixed, I should see:
1. Vercel cron logs show daily execution at 20:00 UTC
2. Database has new snapshots created every weekday
3. Charts show today's data (Sept 30) as the latest point
4. No manual intervention needed

**Please analyze the attached logs and technical details to identify why the market close cron job isn't creating snapshots every day.**
