# Per-Creator Subscription Slots

**Status:** building (Session 15). **Decision:** N=20 concurrent subs/user, **one free trial per user (lifetime)**, uniform pricing.

---

## ✅ What YOU need to do (everything below this section is code reference)

The code is built + committed. These are the only **manual, operator-only** steps, in order:

1. **[✅ DONE] Run the DB migration** `scripts/migrations/2026_06_14_subscription_slot.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. ("Success. No rows returned" is the expected result.)
2. **Confirm the backend deployed.** The slot code is already pushed to `master`; Vercel auto-deploys. Just verify the deploy went green.
3. **Create the slot products in BOTH stores** (the big one): Slots 2–20, **same price** as Slot 1, **no free trial**. Click-by-click in the **"Store console setup"** section further down. *(Until you do this, a user's FIRST subscription still works — it uses Slot 1's existing products — but a SECOND concurrent subscription will fail with "product not available.")*
4. **Ship the apps:** archive a new **iOS** build to TestFlight (picks up the client changes); the **Android** build is already on your Pixel — also push it to the Play internal track.
5. **Test on-device:** subscribe to **two** creators → confirm two independent entries on the store Manage page, the in-app "Subscription A / B" chips match, and canceling one leaves the other active.

*Local testing (optional):* Slots 2–20 are also in `ios/ApesTogetherApp/Configuration.storekit` (regenerate with `python scripts/gen_storekit_slots.py`), so you can exercise the monthly/annual toggle + multi-sub flow in Xcode's local StoreKit environment before creating the real store products.

## Problem

A user can subscribe to many creators, each independently billed and independently
cancelable. The App Store / Play Store only allow **one active subscription per
subscription group (iOS) / per product (Android)** per account, and auto-renewable
products must be **pre-approved** (you can't mint a product per UGC creator at
runtime). So we can't use one shared product for everyone (the old design — it
blocked the 2nd creator with `ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED` and had no way to show *which*
creator on the store Manage page).

## Model: numbered slots + server-side creator attribution

A bounded pool of **N=20 generic, identical-price "slots."** Each slot is its own
iOS **subscription group** (required so the slots are independently cancelable) and
its own pair of products (monthly + annual). The store only ever knows about 20
slots ("Subscription A".."Subscription T"); **which creator a slot maps to is held
entirely on our backend, per-user.** This is the same pattern Twitch uses for
mobile channel subs (a small fixed set of products, target attributed server-side)
— but we keep **auto-renewal** (Twitch's iOS "Sub Tokens" are consumables and lose
auto-renew).

- bobford00's Slot A might be → Wolff; candle3873's Slot A might be → zen1889.
- Store Manage page shows "Subscription A / B / …"; the in-app Subscriptions tab
  shows **"Wolff's Flagship Fund — Subscription A"** + "To cancel, open Manage and
  cancel *Subscription A*." so the user knows which to pick.

### Product-ID scheme

| Slot | Label | Monthly product ID | Annual product ID | Trial? |
|------|-------|--------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | A | `com.apestogether.subscription.monthly` *(existing)* | `com.apestogether.subscription.annual` *(existing)* | **Yes** |
| 2 | B | `com.apestogether.subscription.s02.monthly` | `com.apestogether.subscription.s02.annual` | No |
| … | … | … | … | No |
| 20 | T | `com.apestogether.subscription.s20.monthly` | `com.apestogether.subscription.s20.annual` | No |

Slot 1 **reuses the existing products** (no client/store churn; they already carry
the 7-day trial). Source of truth: `subscription_slots.py`.

### One free trial per user — store-enforced, zero app logic

The 7-day intro offer is configured **only on Slot 1 (A)** products. Because:
1. A user's **first** subscription always lands in Slot A (Slot A is only occupied
   if they already have an active sub there ⇒ they already subscribed once).
2. Intro-offer eligibility is **once per subscription group / product, per account**
   — so even after a user cancels their Slot A sub and a *new* creator later reuses
   Slot A, the store will **not** grant the trial again.

⇒ Exactly **one free trial in a user's lifetime**, enforced natively by both stores.
Slots B–T have no intro offer, so concurrent 2nd/3rd subs bill immediately.

## Backend

### Slot allocation (no reservation table needed)

The store itself prevents double-booking a slot (you can't own Slot A's product
twice), so we just compute the slot **on demand** and bind it at validate time.

A slot is **occupied** for a user if they have a `MobileSubscription` in that slot
that is `active`, or `canceled` but `expires_at` is still in the future (grace —
the store entitlement still exists until period end). Otherwise it's free.

`GET /api/mobile/subscriptions/slot-for-creator?subscribed_to_id=<id>`:
1. Already have an active/grace sub to this creator → `409 {error:"already_subscribed", slot, slot_label}`.
2. Else lowest free slot 1..20. None free → `409 {error:"max_reached", max_slots:20}`.
3. Else `200 {slot, slot_label, monthly_product_id, annual_product_id, max_slots}`.

### Binding

`POST /purchase/validate` is unchanged in shape; it derives the slot from the
**authoritative** purchased `product_id` (`slot_for_product_id`) and stores it on
the `MobileSubscription`. The creator binding lives on the **purchase token /
originalTransactionId** (already how `iap_webhooks._apply_update` matches), so slot
reuse over time is safe — webhooks update the right row regardless of slot number.

`GET /subscriptions` returns `slot` + `slot_label` per made-subscription for the UI.

### Schema change

`MobileSubscription.slot` (Integer, nullable) — `scripts/migrations/2026_06_14_subscription_slot.sql`.

## Clients

Replace the two hardcoded purchase product IDs with **dynamic resolution**:
1. On Subscribe tap, call `slot-for-creator` → get the assigned slot's product IDs.
2. Purchase the monthly/annual product for that slot (per the plan toggle).
3. Validate as today (sends the real `product_id`).
4. `max_reached` → "You've reached the maximum of 20 subscriptions. Cancel one to
   subscribe to another." `already_subscribed` → route to Manage.

Price **display** still uses Slot A products (all slots are the same price), so the
CTA/price UI is unchanged.

Subscriptions tab: show the slot label per row + the "cancel *Subscription X* in
the store" hint (pairs with the single-action Manage button shipped in Session 14).

## Store console setup (manual, one-time)

You create Slots **2–20** in **both** stores. Slot 1 already exists. Every slot
product is the **same price** as Slot 1 ($9/mo, $69/yr) and has **no** intro offer
(only Slot 1 keeps its 7-day trial → one trial per user, lifetime).

Product IDs follow `subscription_slots.py` exactly:
`com.apestogether.subscription.s02.monthly` / `.s02.annual` … through `s20`.

### Exact products to create (Slots 2–20)

Create every row below. Notes on the columns:
- **Subscription Group** — in App Store Connect, use this string for **both** the
  group's *Reference Name* and its (user-facing) *Display Name*. Google Play has no
  groups; ignore this column there.
- **Reference Name** — App Store Connect only: the per-subscription *Reference Name*
  (internal, never shown to users). **Google Play has no equivalent** — for Play, set
  each product's user-facing **Name** to the *Subscription Group* value
  (`Trader Subscription B`) instead, so it matches the in-app cancel hint.
- **Product ID** — identical on both stores and **must match exactly** (lowercase,
  zero-padded `sNN`). This is the only field the app depends on. Enter the **bare
  ID with no surrounding quotes or backticks** — type
  `com.apestogether.subscription.s02.monthly`, not the quoted version you may see
  in this doc or in `subscription_slots.py` (those quotes/backticks are only
  formatting / Python string delimiters).

**Slot 1 (A) already exists** — shown only for reference:
- **Never recreate it or change its Product IDs** (`com.apestogether.subscription.monthly`
  / `.annual`). Both stores forbid editing a product ID after creation, and the
  backend keys Slot 1 off those exact legacy IDs (`subscription_slots.py`).
- **Keep its existing 7-day trial** — that's the one-trial-per-user mechanism.
- **Rename its subscription-group Display Name** from `Apes Together Premium` to
  `Trader Subscription A` so it matches the in-app cancel hint ("cancel the entry
  labeled *Trader Subscription A*"). Group Display Names are editable anytime and
  safe to change (unlike Product IDs). The internal *Reference Names* don't matter —
  align them if you like, but that's optional.

### App Store Connect (iOS) — 19 new subscription groups

Each slot must be its **own subscription group** (Apple allows only one active sub
per group → separate groups = independently cancelable). For each slot `s02`..`s20`:

1. App Store Connect → your app → **Monetization ▸ Subscriptions**.
2. **Subscription Groups → Create** → set both its Reference Name and its
   user-facing **Display Name** to `Trader Subscription B` (B for s02, C for s03, …).
   The Display Name is what users see on the Manage page and **must match the in-app
   cancel hint exactly** ("cancel the entry labeled *Trader Subscription B*"). Do NOT
   put a creator name — the slot→creator mapping is per-user and lives in-app.
3. Inside the group, **Create** two subscriptions, using the exact **Reference
   Name** + **Product ID** from the *"Exact products to create"* table above
   (monthly = duration **1 month**, **$9**; annual = duration **1 year**, **$69**).
4. Add the localized **Display Name** + **Description** — **identical for every
   slot**, matching your existing Slot 1 products:
   - Monthly → Display Name `Monthly Subscription` · Description `Follow a trader's moves in real-time`
   - Annual → Display Name `Annual Subscription` · Description `Follow a trader's moves in real-time — best value`
   *(The per-subscription Reference Name from step 3 is internal-only; this Display
   Name + Description are what users see. They're the same across all slots — the
   slot letter is carried by the GROUP display name, see step 2.)*
5. **Do NOT add an Introductory Offer** (no free trial) on any slot ≥ 2.
6. Submit for review (can be bundled with the next app version or submitted alone).

> Tip: these 19 groups are **already** in `ios/ApesTogetherApp/Configuration.storekit`
> (run `python scripts/gen_storekit_slots.py` to regenerate) so you can test slots in
> the local StoreKit environment now. Sandbox / production use App Store Connect, not
> the .storekit file — so you still need to create them there per the table above.

### Google Play — 38 new products

Play has no "group" concept; distinct products are independently cancelable. The
product's **Name** is what users see on the Play Manage-subscriptions page, so set it
to the slot's *Subscription Group* value (`Trader Subscription B`) so it matches the
in-app cancel hint. Both the monthly and annual product of a slot share that same
Name (a user only ever has one of them active at a time).

Play Console → **Monetize ▸ Products ▸ Subscriptions** → for each `s02`..`s20`:

1. **Create subscription** with the **Product ID** from the table (start with
   `…sNN.monthly`); set its **Name** to the slot's *Subscription Group* value
   (e.g. `Trader Subscription B`).
2. Add a **base plan**: auto-renewing, **1 month**, **$9**, no offer.
3. Repeat for `…sNN.annual`: same **Name** (`Trader Subscription B`), auto-renewing,
   **1 year**, **$69**, **no** free-trial offer.
4. **Activate** each.

> **Slot 1:** rename your existing `…subscription.monthly` / `.annual` products'
> **Name** to `Trader Subscription A` too (Product IDs stay unchanged). Only Slot 1's
> products keep their existing 7-day free-trial offer.

### Don't forget
- Same Small-Business-Program / tax settings as Slot 1 so the payout math
  (`InAppPurchase` defaults) stays correct.
- After publishing, run the on-device test in the checklist below.

### Constraints / decisions baked in
- **Uniform pricing required.** Per-creator pricing would multiply slots × tiers.
- **Max 20 concurrent** subs per user (over-provision is cheap; bump later if needed).
- Generic-but-clear store display names ("Trader Subscription A"); real mapping in-app.

## Checklist
- [ ] `subscription_slots.py` catalog
- [ ] `MobileSubscription.slot` column + migration run in Supabase
- [ ] `/subscriptions/slot-for-creator` endpoint

- [ ] Android dynamic resolution + max UI + tab labels
- [ ] App Store Connect: 19 new groups (no trial), same price
- [ ] Play Console: 38 new products (no trial), same price
