# üßπ Portfolio Snapshot Cleanup Plan

## üìã OVERVIEW

We have corrupted portfolio snapshots from early software development where:
- Snapshots were created BEFORE users had any assets
- Backfill assigned baseline values ($7,279.22) to dates when user owned nothing
- This causes flat 0% gains in charts and misrepresents portfolio history
- Charts show lines going back to dates before the user even started trading

## üéØ OBJECTIVES

1. **Identify First Real Holdings Date** for each user
2. **Delete Corrupted Snapshots** from before that date
3. **Backfill Accurate Historical Prices** for all user assets
4. **Rebuild Snapshots** with correct values from first holdings date forward
5. **Fix Chart Display** to show no line before user started trading
6. **Recalculate Gains** starting from actual first holdings date

---

## üö® CRITICAL DESIGN DECISIONS

### Design Decision 1: End-of-Day Snapshots Only

**Current Design:**
- Portfolio snapshots are taken at **market close** (end of day)
- Snapshot uses closing prices from `MarketData.close_price`
- All transactions during the day are aggregated to determine EOD holdings

**Intraday Trading Handling:**
```
Example: User buys 100 AAPL at 10:05 AM ($150) and sells at 10:15 AM ($151)
- Intraday gain: $100 (captured in Transaction table)
- EOD holdings: 0 shares of AAPL
- EOD snapshot: Portfolio value WITHOUT AAPL
- Impact: Realized gains/losses are reflected in cash balance, not EOD snapshot
```

**Why This Works:**
- Snapshots show "what you own at market close"
- Realized gains become cash (increases buying power for other stocks)
- Matches how traditional brokerages report portfolio value
- Simplifies chart generation (one data point per day)

**What We Capture:**
‚úÖ EOD portfolio value based on holdings √ó close prices  
‚úÖ Transaction history (all buys/sells with timestamps)  
‚úÖ Realized gains in transaction records  
‚ùå Intraday portfolio fluctuations  
‚ùå High-water marks during the day  

**Future Enhancement (Phase 7 - Optional):**
- Add "Realized Gains" field to snapshots
- Calculate cumulative realized gains from all sold positions
- Display alongside unrealized gains in portfolio

### Design Decision 2: Chart Handling of Missing Data

**Problem:** What happens when user has no assets or no snapshot for a date?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Chart.js handles missing data points gracefully:
// - If data array is empty: Chart shows "No data available"
// - If data array has gaps: Chart skips those dates (no line segment)
// - If labels exist but data is null: Point is skipped

// Example:
{
  labels: ['2025-06-19', '2025-06-20', null, '2025-06-23'],  // null = skip
  data:   [10000,        10200,        null, 10500]           // null = no point
}

// For dates before first holdings:
// Simply don't include them in labels/data arrays at all
// Chart will start from first holdings date automatically
```

**Implementation:**
1. Query snapshots WHERE `date >= first_holdings_date`
2. Filter out weekends and dates with no data
3. Chart automatically shows no line before first data point
4. No crash, no special handling needed

**Cache Safety:**
- Cache is keyed by `(user_id, period)`
- When we delete old snapshots, we invalidate cache: `cache.delete_memoized(get_chart_data, user_id)`
- New cache will be generated with correct date range
- No stale data served

### Design Decision 3: Market Data Timing

**Question:** Were prices fetched when user added assets on 6/19/2025?

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check Transaction table for exact timestamps
- Check if MarketData exists for those tickers on 6/19/2025
- Determine if Alpha Vantage call was made at time of purchase

**Two Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Real-time prices were fetched**
- User bought at 10:05 AM
- Alpha Vantage called immediately
- `transaction.price` = real-time quote
- `MarketData.close_price` = EOD price (fetched later)
- **For snapshots:** Use `MarketData.close_price` (standardized)

**Scenario B: Prices were backfilled later**
- User bought at 10:05 AM
- `transaction.price` = user-entered or estimated
- `MarketData` was backfilled from yfinance weeks later
- **For snapshots:** Still use `MarketData.close_price` (most accurate)

**Endpoint to Investigate:** `/admin/investigate-first-assets?username=witty-raven`
- Shows first transaction timestamp
- Shows whether market data exists
- Shows intraday trading patterns

## üìä PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT & DISCOVERY

### 1.1 Create User Assessment Tool

**Purpose:** Find the REAL first holdings date for each user

**Logic:**
```python
def find_first_real_holdings_date(user_id):
    """
    Find the first date when user actually held stocks.
    
    Rules:
    - Check Stock table for earliest purchase_date
    - Check Transaction table for earliest BUY timestamp
    - If user bought AND sold same day, that still counts as first holdings date
    - Return None if user never had holdings
    """
    
    # Method 1: Check Stock table (current holdings)
    first_stock = Stock.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id)\
        .order_by(Stock.purchase_date.asc()).first()
    
    # Method 2: Check Transaction table (includes sold positions)
    first_transaction = Transaction.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id)\
        .filter_by(type='buy')\
        .order_by(Transaction.timestamp.asc()).first()
    
    # Take the earlier of the two
    dates = []
    if first_stock:
        dates.append(first_stock.purchase_date)
    if first_transaction:
        dates.append(first_transaction.timestamp.date())
    
    return min(dates) if dates else None
```

### 1.2 Generate Assessment Report

**Endpoint:** `/admin/assess-portfolio-data`

**Output:**
```

## üóëÔ∏è PHASE 2: DELETE CORRUPTED SNAPSHOTS

### 2.1 Create Deletion Script

**Purpose:** Remove snapshots from before user's first holdings date

**Safety:**
- DRY RUN mode to preview deletions
- Requires explicit confirmation
- Backs up deleted snapshot data to JSON file
- Can be reversed if needed

**Script:** `delete_corrupted_snapshots.py`

```python
def delete_corrupted_snapshots(user_id, first_holdings_date, dry_run=True):
    """
    Delete portfolio snapshots from before user had any holdings.
    
    Args:
        user_id: User to clean up
        first_holdings_date: First date user had stocks
        dry_run: If True, only show what would be deleted
    
    Returns:
        Number of snapshots deleted
    """
    
    # Find corrupted snapshots
    corrupted = PortfolioSnapshot.query.filter(
        PortfolioSnapshot.user_id == user_id,
        PortfolioSnapshot.date < first_holdings_date
    ).all()
    
    if dry_run:
        print(f"DRY RUN: Would delete {len(corrupted)} snapshots")
        for snap in corrupted:
            print(f"  - {snap.date}: ${snap.total_value}")
        return 0
    
    # Backup before deletion
    backup = [{
        'date': snap.date.isoformat(),
        'total_value': float(snap.total_value),
        'percentage_gain': float(snap.percentage_gain)
    } for snap in corrupted]
    
    backup_file = f'snapshot_backup_{user_id}_{datetime.now():%Y%m%d_%H%M%S}.json'
    with open(backup_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(backup, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"Backed up {len(corrupted)} snapshots to {backup_file}")
    
    # Delete
    for snap in corrupted:
        db.session.delete(snap)
    
    db.session.commit()
    
    print(f"‚úÖ Deleted {len(corrupted)} corrupted snapshots")
    return len(corrupted)
```

### 2.2 Admin Interface for Deletion

**Add to admin page:**

```html
<div class="batch">
    <h3>üóëÔ∏è Phase 2: Delete Corrupted Snapshots</h3>
    <p>Run DRY RUN first to see what would be deleted</p>
    
    <button onclick="deleteCorruptedSnapshots('witty-raven', true)">
        üëÅÔ∏è DRY RUN: witty-raven
    </button>
    <button onclick="deleteCorruptedSnapshots('witty-raven', false)">
        üóëÔ∏è DELETE: witty-raven
    </button>
    
    <!-- Repeat for other users -->
</div>
```

## üí∞ PHASE 3: BACKFILL HISTORICAL MARKET DATA

### 3.1 Identify Missing Historical Prices

**Purpose:** Ensure we have market data for all dates we need to recreate snapshots

**Logic:**
```python
def identify_missing_market_data(user_id, first_holdings_date):
    """
    Find which historical prices we need to backfill.
    
    For each stock the user has EVER owned (current + sold):

                'first_needed': start_date,
                'missing_dates': missing,
                'count': len(missing)
            }
    
    return missing_data
```

### 3.2 Backfill Script

**Script:** `backfill_user_historical_prices.py`

```python
def backfill_user_historical_prices(user_id, first_holdings_date):
    """
    Backfill historical prices for all stocks user has owned.
    
    Uses yfinance to fetch missing historical data.

        # Fetch from yfinance
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        hist = stock.history(

## üîÑ PHASE 4: REBUILD PORTFOLIO SNAPSHOTS

### 4.1 Snapshot Rebuild Logic

**Purpose:** Create accurate snapshots from first holdings date to today

**Key Points:**
- Only create snapshots for dates when user had holdings
- Use actual market data for each date
- Calculate correct portfolio value based on holdings √ó prices
- Properly handle same-day buy/sell scenarios

**Script:** `rebuild_user_snapshots.py`

```python

## üìà PHASE 5: FIX CHART DISPLAY

### 5.1 Update Chart Data Generation

**File:** `leaderboard_utils.py`

    NEW BEHAVIOR:
    - If period goes back further than user's first holdings date,

### 5.2 Chart Frontend Updates

**Show message when data range is limited:**

```javascript
// In chart rendering code
if (chartData.first_holdings_date) {
    const note = document.createElement('div');
    note.className = 'chart-note';
    note.innerHTML = `üìä Portfolio history starts ${chartData.first_holdings_date}`;

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

Before deployment:
- [ ] DRY RUN all deletions
- [ ] Backup all data
- [ ] Test on one user first (testing2 - has no real holdings)
- [ ] Verify snapshots match manual calculations
- [ ] Check charts display correctly
- [ ] Confirm leaderboard unchanged (if assets unchanged)
- [ ] Test all chart periods (5D, 1M, 3M, 1Y, ALL)
- [ ] Verify weekend filtering still works
- [ ] Check transaction timeline in debug tool

## üö® RISKS & MITIGATION

**Risk 1:** Delete too many snapshots
- **Mitigation:** DRY RUN first, review carefully, backup before deletion

**Risk 2:** Missing historical market data
- **Mitigation:** Use multiple data sources, handle gaps gracefully

**Risk 3:** Incorrect portfolio value calculations
- **Mitigation:** Compare against manual calculations, spot-check

**Risk 4:** Same-day buy/sell scenarios
- **Mitigation:** Use end-of-day snapshot, ensure transactions applied in order

**Risk 5:** Timezone issues with transaction timestamps
- **Mitigation:** Convert all to same timezone, use `.date()` for snapshots

## üìù NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Review enhanced debug tool** (deployed now)
   - Look at witty-raven timeline
   - Identify first REAL holdings date
   - Count corrupted snapshot days

2. **Create assessment endpoint**
   - Build `/admin/assess-portfolio-data`
   - Generate report for all users
   - Confirm cleanup targets

3. **Build deletion script**
   - Create DRY RUN mode
   - Add backup functionality
   - Test on testing2 user first
